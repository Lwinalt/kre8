### KRE8 empowers DevOps engineers to manage their Kubernetes cluster on AWS from their desktop

KRE8 is an Electron application for MacOS that enables DevOps teams to view and interact with their Kubernetes cluster on Amazon Web Services, right from their desktop. The app features an interactive visualizer with real-time metrics on the status of your pods, services and deployments. The days of assembling metrics from AWS and kubectl to put together reports on your cluster are over! 

### KRE8 is in active development. Please follow this repo for contribution guidelines and our development road map.

### Interactive Kubernetes Visualizer
The interactive visualizer enables developers to view the status of their cluster in realtime. Click on the individual elements within your cluster to get realtime data and metrics.
